            <h2>History of marathon</h2>
            <p>The Marathon has been an Olympic distance since the modern Olympics started in 1896, but nothing like it was ever seen in the ancient Olympics, run from 776BC to 261AD. The longest race then was less than 5km. The Marathon was adopted as a central part of the modern Olympic programme, and takes place in countless cities all over the world today, purely because of its popular appeal to the imagination.<br> Humans had once run distances far greater than a marathon. As a hunter, one of man’s greatest assets was his stamina. He would run his prey ragged. The hunted animal would bound away to apparent safety, only for the dogged hunter to turn up alongside again. This would go on until the animal, squandering its energy in nervous bursts, was rendered too exhausted to resist.</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits for your physical Health</h2>
            <ul>
                 <li><span>Improved overall health:</span> Running regulary strengthens your heart by increasing you aerobic capacity and helping keep your blood pressure and high cholestrol at healthy level.It also improves your immune system and increases muscle strength. In addition, longer runs push your body to strengthen fast-twitch fibers in the muscles to combat fatigue and build strength and power.</li>
                 <li><span>Better sleep:</span> Marathon training can be exhausting. Your body will crave sleep, since it repairs itself while you’re resting. You’ll find yourself getting to bed earlier and sleeping more soundly.</li>
                 <li><span>Room for extra calories:</span>During your very long runs, you’ll be burning thousands of calories, so it’s OK to be a little indulgent after. You will be hungry,  after all. You can run hard, and celebrate hard.</li>
                 
            </ul>
              <h2>Benefits to your mental health</h2>
               <p>Long runs play a big role in helping you hone your mental toughness and develop a coping system to deal with running day-after-day, mile-after-mile, in tough conditions. Running a marathon will also help you reap the following benefits.</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><span>Stress reduction:</span> Research suggests that running in times of stress helps you better handle life's challenges by increasing your mental resilience.</li>
                 <li><span>A new outlook:</span> This well-known maxim says it all: “The person who starts a marathon is not the same person who finishes a marathon.” You are sure to be a different person at the finish line because you’ll forever know that you have the mental and physical strength to persevere, even during times when you think you can’t and won’t succeed.</li>
                 <li><span>Improved motivation:</span> You can’t get away with not training when it comes to a marathon, so having one on your calendar will keep you motivated to stick to your training schedule. On days when your motivation is lacking, you'll think about how you'll feel if you're undertrained, can’t finish, or have to cancel and find the strength train anyway.</li>
             </ul>
